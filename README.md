# Nonlinear-Time-Series-Model
The aim is to study and understand various different non-linear time series models and apply Markov Switching Model to a given data set and extract information out of it.

In the modern world of fluctuating economies, uncertain events and various unpredictable situations in the financial domain, to draw a pattern in the financial
time data is getting difficult. With the current financial time series data, only
the use of linear models is not sufficient as the data may itself have non-linearity.
In such situations working with the linear time series models becomes futile.
To study or draw patterns in such non-linear data, we have to make use of non linear time series models to draw inferences out of the non-linear time series
data.
